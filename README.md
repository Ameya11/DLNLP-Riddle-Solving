# DLNLP: Riddle Sense Project

## Overview

This project is focused on solving riddle-based questions using a machine learning model. Given a sentence (riddle) `sᵢ = {Tᵢ₁, Tᵢ₂, ..., Tᵢₗ}` where `L` is the sentence length and a choice set `cᵢ = {c₁, c₂, c₃, ..., cₖ}`, where `k (>2)` is the total number of choices and each `cᵢ` is a unique text representing one of the choices, the model predicts the probability of each choice being the correct answer.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: Contains Jupyter Notebook scripts used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **Result**: Includes the inference results generated by the model.
- **riddle_sense**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **src**: Includes source code and log files for the project.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes:

- **id**: A unique identifier for each riddle.
- **Question**: The riddle or question that needs to be answered.
- **Choices**: A set of 5 objective-type options for the question, each with a label and an option value.
- **AnswerKey**: The label value corresponding to the correct answer.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ameya11/riddle_sense.git
   cd riddle_sense
   ```

2. **Running the Model**:
   - Navigate to the `Notebook` directory and open the relevant Jupyter Notebooks to explore data, train models, and view inference results.
   - Use the scripts in the `src` directory to run the model on new data or retrain it with different parameters.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - Check the `Result` directory for output files and inference results.
